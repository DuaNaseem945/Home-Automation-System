# Home Automation System

This project is a C++ application simulating basic functionalities of a home automation system. It leverages object-oriented programming principles and provides time-based features.

---

## Features
- **Time Formatting:** Displays the current time in a formatted manner.
- **Dynamic Greetings:** Outputs time-specific greetings such as "Good Morning" or "Good Evening."
- **Night-Time Detection:** Identifies whether the current time is during the night (e.g., 7 PM to 6 AM).
